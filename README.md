# **Integration of Artificial Intelligence with ASR for Ticket Management**

## **Project description**
This project was developed as part of an end-of-studies initiative. The main goal was to:
- Develop a web app to collect domain-specific audio-text data in English and Tunisian dialect.
- Fine-tune ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models for both languages, optimizing their performance for ticket management tasks.
- Integrate the fine-tuned ASR models, a language model, and automation scripts into a ticket management platform to enable real-time transcription and task automation.
